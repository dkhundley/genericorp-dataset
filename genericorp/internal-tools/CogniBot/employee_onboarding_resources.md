When you start a new job, one of the most important things to get right is onboarding—essentially, how a company helps new employees get up to speed and feel comfortable in their new roles. At GeneriCorp, the onboarding process is particularly crucial because the company has a rich history of innovation and a fast-paced environment that constantly evolves. With so many different teams and technologies, it’s vital that new hires have access to the right resources from day one.

Enter **CogniBot**, GeneriCorp’s AI-powered IT helpdesk assistant. This tool is like having a knowledgeable buddy right at your fingertips, ready to help you navigate the tech landscape of the company. CogniBot specializes in providing technical support, troubleshooting software issues, and handling those pesky password resets we all dread. It uses GeneriCorp’s Magnus RAG system to pull up internal documentation, so you can find the answers you need without having to dig through endless files or wait for IT support to become available.

Why does this matter? For GeneriCorp, which has transitioned from humble beginnings in a garage to becoming a Fortune 500 giant, ensuring that new employees can hit the ground running is essential for maintaining momentum and driving innovation. With the company’s focus on industrial automation and AI-driven solutions, having a tool like CogniBot helps streamline the onboarding process, allowing new hires to focus on their roles rather than getting bogged down by tech issues.
