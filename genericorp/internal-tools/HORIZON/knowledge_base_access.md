In today’s fast-paced tech world, effective collaboration is key to innovation. At GeneriCorp, we’ve always embraced the spirit of teamwork, whether it was Frank Grayson tinkering in his garage with college buddies or Maggie Chen turning mishaps into multi-million-dollar contracts. This spirit lives on in our latest tool, HORIZON, a next-generation R&D collaboration hub that allows engineers and AI researchers to come together in a secure virtual workspace.
